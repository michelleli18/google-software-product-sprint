      <p>I go to Caltech. A place full of the brightest minds, or at least that's what the professors are assuming when they give us the hardest sets ever seen in mankind ;-;;; It's a small campus, but California blesses us with the beautiful sunsets and comfy weather.</p>

      <p>These are the homies. The people that brighten my days at school, the ones to grind sets with, and the ones that will go on spontaneous adventures w me at like 3 in the morning.</p>
